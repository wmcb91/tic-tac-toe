User Stories:

1. As a new user I want an easy sign up feature.
2. As a user, I want to be able to track the number of games I have played
3. As a user, I want to know if there is an issue when I try to sign up or sign in
4. As a user, I want to be able to change my password
5. As a user, I want to be able to 'rage quit' and start a new game mid game
6. As a user, I want to be able to start a new game after I won without refreshing

Planning

I planned on sketching a wireframe outline on a notepad and using that as my
basis for creating a more detailed wireframe using balsalmiq Mockups. Once the
wireframe was complete, I wanted to write most of my HTML, my basic SCSS and
login API before writing my game logic before and game API. After getting the
basic game functioning, I wanted to go back to my HTML and SCSS to write more
advanced code to improve the look and function of the front-end UI for the app.
Last, I planned on running through every aspect of the application to check for
bugs and possibly discover features I wanted to add.

Story

On day 1 (Wednesday), I made my wireframe using balsalmiq and had it finished by
the end of the day.

On Thursday, was able to write out most of my HTML for game but really did
not stick to the plan after that.  I wrote SCSS and got a basic game look but
was picky and took far too much time making small changes to get the look right.
I wrote the Authorization API and got it functioning but I did not move on when
I should have and added Authorization features that should have been added
towards the end of development.  The game did look good, but I wasn't close to
working.

On Friday, I began to realize how far off pace I was and began my game logic and
game API, but struggled with sticking with just one task and began bouncing
around which wasted time. By the end of the day, I could show pieces on my board
when clicked, and had progress in the logic, but did not have a working game.
