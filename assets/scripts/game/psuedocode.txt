For first game in session, X, the player who created the game, plays first
player-turn displays 'player X'

X can click in any game-cell and render an X in that space
  API.game sends X to the array in that position
  API.user switches user to player O
  player-turn displays 'player O'
  the array position becomes unclickable

O can play in any free space
  API.game sends X to the array in that position
  API.user switches user to player O
  player-turn displays 'player O'
  the array position becomes unclickable

X can play in any free space
  API.game sends X to the array in that position

  the array position becomes unclickable

  X can play in any free space
    IF X plays in space that connects three X's in a row
